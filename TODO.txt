Main idea of motor learning is the ball should stop when your hand stops. its speed should bderivative of your speed
	Note evn though the ball doesnt follow your hand and its velocity is a derivaticve it should finally catch up with your hand position
Roll a ball (control ball with tracking hand velocity and not hand position)
Doodle jump
